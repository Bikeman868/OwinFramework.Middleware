        <h1>Owin Framework output cache middleware configuration</h1>
        <p>The output cache middleware in the Owin  Framework supports the following configuration options:</p>
        <table class="properties">
            <tr>
                <th>Property</th>
                <th>Default</th>
                <th>Current</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="property">documentationRootUrl</td>
                <td>{documentationRootUrl.default}</td>
                <td>{documentationRootUrl}</td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                        The relative path within your site to the documentation
                        for this versioning middleware.
                    </p>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="property">version</td>
                <td>{version.default}</td>
                <td>{version}</td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                        This is the version number that will be added to asset URLs so that
                        the browser can cache them indefinately. When you release a new version
                        of your website you should increment this version number so that all the
                        assets are dowmloaded again by the browser.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Set this property to <span class="code">null</span> to disable versioning.
                        This is useful for development environments where you don't want to have to
                        update the version number every time you modify a website file.
                    </p>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="property">mimeTypes</td>
                <td>{mimeTypes.default}</td>
                <td>{mimeTypes}</td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                        This is an array of mime types that should have version references replaced
                        with the current version number. Whenever downstream middleware sets the
                        <span class="code">Content-Type</span> header to one of these mime types
                        the response body will be treated as text, ans will have all occurrences
                        of <span class="code">{_v_}</span> replaced with the current version.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <span class="code">{_v_}</span> markers should be placed immediately
                        before the file extension in the URLs of static assets. Static assets are
                        usually files that are deployed with your web site that do not change between
                        deployments. They can also be handlers that generate the content dynamically,
                        but this content should not change for a specific version of your website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example <span class="code">&lt;img src="/images/logo{_v_}.png" /></span>
                        will be replaced with <span class="code">&lt;img src="/images/logo_v3.png" /></span>
                        if the version property is 3.
                    </p>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="property">fileExtensions</td>
                <td>{fileExtensions.default}</td>
                <td>{fileExtensions}</td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                        This is an array of file extensions for the types of files that can contain
                        a version number. This middleware will strip out the version number from
                        these URLs in the request before passing the request down to the next middleware
                        in the chain, so that downstream middleware is oblivious to the versioning that
                        is taking place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Setting this property to <span class="code">null</span> or an empty list will cause
                        the middleware to apply versioning to all requests that look like file names with
                        version numbers, i.e they have the form <span class="code">/path/path/filename_vxx.ext</span>
                        where <span class="code">xx</span> is a version number.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example if your website receives a GET request for <span class="code">/images/logo_v3.png</span>
                        the URL in the request will be modified to <span class="code">/images/logo.png</span> before
                        chaining the downstream middleware.
                    </p>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="property">browserCacheTime</td>
                <td>{browserCacheTime.default}</td>
                <td>{browserCacheTime}</td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                        This specifies how long the browser should cache versioned assets. Unversioned assets
                        will not have any cache related headers added to the response.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Setting this property to <span class="code">null</span> will send a header
                        to the browser instructing it to not cache the asset. This is useful in development
                        environments.

                <td>
                    <p>
                        When this property is <span class="code">true</span> requests for assets with an old version
                        number will result in a 404 (not found) response.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When this property is <span class="code">false</span> the version number is not checked so 
                        requests for older versions will result in the current version of the asset being served.

        <p>
            This middleware is configured the same way as all other middleware in the Owin Framework; you need 
            to construct a class that implements <span class="code">IConfiguration</span> then add a fluid 
            <span class="code">.ConfigureWith()</span> when you register this middleware with the Owin 
            Framework builder. Please read Owin Framework documentation on configuration for full details with examples.
