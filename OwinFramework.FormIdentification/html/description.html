This middleware allows users of your site to:

<ul>
    <li>
        Create an account using an email address and a password by making an HTTPS POST
        request to the URL that you have configured (defaults to <span class="code">/formId/signup</span>). On success
        redirects the user to a welcome page whose URL you can configure (defaults to <span class="code">/welcome</span>).
        On failure redirects the user to a failed/retry page whose URL you can configure
        (defaults to <span class="code">/formId/signup</span>). Your application is responsible for delivering the UI, this
        middleware just accepts the POST, creates the account or not, and performs a redriection.
    </li>

    <li>
        Log into an existing account using the email address and password used to create the
        account. The email and password must be sent in an HTTPS POST to a URL that you can
        configure (defaults to <span class="code">/formId/signin</span>). The POST will result in a redirect response. The URLs
        for the success and fail cases can both be configured. Your application is responsible for
        handling the HTTP(S) GET requests for these URLs.
    </li>

    <li>
        Change their password by providing their current password and a new one.
    </li>

    <li>
        Logout, securing their account.
    </li>

    <li>
        Request a time-limited password reset email to be sent.
    </li>

    <li>
        Click the single use link in the password reset email and reset their password
        without knowing their current password.
    </li>

</ul>

<p>
    Note that there are other middleware packages that provide user identification from
    social media, shared secrets and certificates. These middleware packages will all work
    togther because each one will look to see if the user is already identified before
    trying to perform its own identification. The first middleware in the pipeline that
    successfully identifies the user will supply the user identity to the reast of the
    pipeline and other identification middleware will not make any additional user
    identification attempts after the user is identified.
</p>

<p>
    Note that this middleware will store a cookie on the browser to indicate who the user
    is logged in as. The lifetime of the cookie is configurable and defaults to 90 days.
    To keep this cookie secure this middleware performs a few extra redirections that mean
    that the cookie can be stored on the browser in a different domain than the non secure
    pages of the site are served from.
</p>

<p>
    When a browser makes a request to a server it includes all of the cookies that are stored
    for that domain (for example <span class="code">www.mycompany.com</span>). If the login request set cookies in
    the <span class="code">www.mycompany.com</span> domain then every time the browser requested any page in the
    <span class="code">www.mycompany.com</span> domain it would send the cookie, and if any of these requests are not
    encrypted (even requets for images or stylesheets etc) then anyone watching could copy
    the cookie value and use it to impersonate that user for 90 days.
</p>

<p>
    For this reason this middleware assumes that you will use a sub-domain for log in etc
    and store cookies in this sub-domain on the browser so that they will not be sent with
    non secure page requests. You don't have to do this and it will still work, but you
    must then make sure all requests to your site are secure (using HTTPS) and if a user
    types HTTP into their browser their user account will be at risk even if your server
    does not handle the request.
</p>

<p>
    Lets assume that your main site domain is <span class="code">http://www.mycompany.com/</span> and you choose to
    use <span class="code">https://secure.mycompany.com/</span> for login, this is what happens when a user visits
    your site:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        The very first time they visit <span class="code">http://www.mycompany.com/</span> this middleware will notice
        that there is no login token in session and will redirect the browser to a page on the
        secure sub-domain, for example <span class="code">https://secure.mycompany.com/renewSession</span> since this
        is their first visit and no cookies have been set, tihs will store a value in session
        indicating that they are an anonymous user and redirect them back to the page that
        they initially requested. Now when the browser re-requests  <span class="code">http://www.mycompany.com/</span>
        this middleware will find the anonymous token in session and serve the page as an
        unidentified user.
    </li>

    <li>
        For subsequent requests during the session, requests will continue to be processed as
        an unidentified user. When the session times out, the process will revert back to step 1.
    </li>

    <li>
        If the user decides to sign in by POSTing to <span class="code">https://secure.mycompany.com/signin</span> then
        this middleware will check their credentials and respond with a page containing a
        cookie that identifies the user and JavaScript to load <span class="code">https://secure.mycompany.com/renewSession</span>.
        This will store the user identification cookie on the browser in the <span class="code">secure.mycompany.com</span>
        domain and load <span class="code">https://secure.mycompany.com/renewSession</span>.
    </li>

    <li>
        When the browser makes a request to <span class="code">https://secure.mycompany.com/renewSession</span> is will
        include the cookies for the <span class="code">secure.mycompany.com</span> domain, including the user identification
        cookie. This middleware will handle this request by putting information into the users
        session about their identity, and redirecting back to the page they first came from on
        <span class="code">http://www.mycompany.com/</span>.
    </li>

    <li>
        When this middleware receives a request for <span class="code">http://www.mycompany.com/</span> it will see the
        user's identity in their session and process the request as that identified user. Note that
        the browser does not send the user identification cookie because this is for a different
        domain (<span class="code">www.mycompany.com</span> instead of <span class="code">secure.mycompany.com</span>).
    </li>

    <li>
        If the user's session expires whilst they are logged on, then this middleware will redirect
        the browser to  <span class="code">https://secure.mycompany.com/renewSession</span>. When the browser makes this
        request, because it is for the <span class="code">secure.mycompany.com</span> domain the user identification cookie
        will be included in the request. This middleware will handle this request by storing the
        user identity in the new session just like in step 4.
    </li>
</ol>
