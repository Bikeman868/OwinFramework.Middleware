<p>
    This middleware traverses the OWIN pipeline and finds all of the middleware that implements 
    the <span class="code">ISelfDocumenting</span> interface. It calls methods of this interface
    to gather up all of the documentation for all of the installed middleware and formats in into
    a big document that provides details of all of the installed components.
</p>
<p>
    The document produced by this middleware is template driven. The default templates are embedded
    in the assembly, but it looks on disk before using them, so you can override the templates
    to customize the html and the css and produce the document in whatever format you want.
