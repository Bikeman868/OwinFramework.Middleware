                    sheet with a version number, so the browser will only request this file once and any
                    changes you make to this file will not be reflected in the browser.

                    The home.html page has a reference to the style sheet that is not versioned. Note that
                    the LESS compiler tells the Output Cache middleware to cache and reuse the CSS output so
                    that the compilation does not occur every time. This causes the output cache to add
                    a header telling the browser to cache the file for a few hours. If the output cache gets
                    a request for the CSS file and the underlying LESS file has been modified then it will
                    not use the cached data, but pass the request on to the rest of the OWIN pipeline and
                    the Less Middleware will re-compile the changed file.
