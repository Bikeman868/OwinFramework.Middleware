        <h1>OwinFramework Dart middleware configuration</h1>
        <p>
            This middleware provides an easy way to serve user interfaces written in the Dart programming
            language. See https://www.dartlang.org/ for more details about this language. In brief, Dart
            is a modern language that is very similar to C# and Java that compiles into JavaScript. The
            resulting JavaScript is var compact and highly optimized for best performance in current
            browsers. Dart has a very small footprint and very fast startup times.
        </p>
        <p>
            This middleware exists because some browsers can natively execute Dart directly whereas other
            browsers require the compiled JavaScript. This middleware is similar to the static files
            middleware, and can be used in place of it, but adds browser detection, and serving of
            either the raw Dart code or the compiled JavaScript if the browser does not support Dart 
            natively.
        </p>
        <p>The Dart middleware in the OwinFramework supports the following configuration options:</p>
        <table class="properties">
            <tr>
                <th>Property</th>
                <th>Default</th>
                <th>Current</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="property">DartUiRootUrl</td>
                <td>{dartUiRootUrl.default}</td>
                <td>{dartUiRootUrl}</td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                        Configures the URL within your web site where the Dart UI will be served. If your whole web site
                        is written as Dart Single Page Application you can set this to <span class="code">/</span> so that 
                        when visitors to your site go to http://mysite.com/ they will be presented with the Dart authored UI.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The default setting for this property is <span class="code">/ui</span> which means that any requests
                        to your site that begin with <span class="code">/ui</span> could be served as Dart files or related
                        assets. So for example a URL like <span class="code">/ui/images/logo.jpg</span> would be treated as
                        a resource for your Dart application.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This middleware will only serve files that actually exist in the file system. If the
                        request is for a non-existent file then the request will be passed to the next middleware
                        in the OWIN pipeline. If you want 404 to be returned in this situation, then place some
                        middleware behind this one in the OWIN pipeline that returns a 404 response.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Configures the file that will be served when the Dart UI folder URL is requested with no
                        file name in the URL. For example if the <span class="code">DartUiRootUrl</span> is configured
                        to <span class="code">/ui</span> and this property is configured to <span class="code">index.html</span>
                        then a request for <span class="code">http://mysite.com/ui</span> will serve up the contents of 
                        the <span class="code">index.html</span> file.

                        middleware will be avialble. Set this to an empty string to disable this documentation
                        in a production environment.

                    <p>
                        Configures the path in the file system where Dart source files reside. This path can be
                        relative to the root folder of the site, or an absolute path to anywhere on the file system
                        including a UNC path to a network resource.

                    <p>
                        These files will only be served to browsers that natively support execution of Dart code.
                        Using one of these browsers makes it easy to debug your Dart code using the developer tools
                        built into the browser. Debugging the compiled JavaScript in the browser is extremely challenging.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Configures the path in the file system where compiled JavaScript files reside. This path can be
                        relative to the root folder of the site, or an absolute path to anywhere on the file system
                        including a UNC path to a network resource.

                    <p>
                        The Dart compiler outputs to a <span class="code">build</span> folder by default. This is the
                        default location for this middleware too, so the default configuration of every component will
                        work right away out of the box.

                        This can be useful in cases where the Dart UI is some type of diagnostic tool that only
                        operates in certain environments and not in others, but you want to deploy the same build
                        to all environments.

                    <p>
                        Each file extension has some additional parameters that can be configured to specify how these
                        files should be handled as follows:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="code">extension</span><span> is a file extension to serve including leading period</span></li>
                        <li><span class="code">mimeType</span><span> is what to send back to the browser in the <span class="code">Content-Type</span> header</span></li>
                        <li><span class="code">processing</span><span> specified what transformations are applied to the file on disk before returning it t the browser (see below)</span></li>
                        <li><span class="code">expiry</span><span> is how long the broswer can cache this file for. Set to null to disable browser caching</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The possible values for the <span class="code">processing</span> attribute are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="code">none</span><span> which means serve the file excatly as it is on disk</span></li>
                        <li><span class="code">html</span><span> replaces all verson tags with the current version number so that versioned assets will br requested by the browser</span></li>
                        <li><span class="code">javaScript</span><span> has the same processing as html</span></li>
                        <li><span class="code">css</span><span> this is the same as <span class="code">none</span> in this version of the code</span></li>

                    <p>
                        The RequiredPermission property allows you to restrict access to the Dart UI. For example
                        the Dart UI might be an administration UI that should only be availble to administrators. Note
                        that this will not work well if the authorized users use the UI from a shared browsers because
                        the broswer can cache the dart code and associated assets and display the UI to users that
                        are not authorized.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For this to work you must have some Authorization middleware configured in your Owin
                        pipeline. The name of the permission that you specify here is any permission recognized
                        by the Authorization middleware that you configured.

                        Files will not be cached in memory for longer than this timespan. This enabled you
                        to replace the files on the file system and have them gradually replace the old ones.
                    </p>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                        So that browser caching works efficiently, static files can be versioned in the URL
                        without having to be versioned on disk. This middleware will replace occurences of
                        <span class="code">{_V_}</span> in your HTML with this version number and instruct
                        the broswer to cache the file and not request it from the server again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the files have actually changed on disk and you want all the browsers to fetch
                        and cache the new version you should increase this version number by 1.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When this middleware receives a request for a versioned asset, it will strip off the
                        version number before identifying the file to serve, so that the developer does not
                        have to be concerned with the versioning of the files.
                    </p>

            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            This middleware is configured the same way as all other middleware in the Owin Framework; you need 
            to construct a class that implements <span class="code">IConfiguration</span> then add a fluid 
            <span class="code">.ConfigureWith()</span> when you register this middleware with the Owin 
            Framework builder. Please read Owin Framework documentation on configuration for full details with examples.
