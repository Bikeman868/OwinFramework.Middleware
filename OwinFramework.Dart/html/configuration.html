        <h1>OwinFramework Dart middleware configuration</h1>
        <p>
            This middleware provides an easy way to serve user interfaces written in the Dart programming
            language. See https://www.dartlang.org/ for more details about this language. In brief, Dart
            is a modern language that is very similar to C# and Java that compiles into JavaScript. The
            resulting JavaScript is var compact and highly optimized for best performance in current
            browsers. Dart has a very small footprint and very fast startup times.
        </p>
        <p>
            This middleware exists because some browsers can natively execute Dart directly whereas other
            browsers require the compiled JavaScript. This middleware is designed to sit in front of the 
            static files middleware. It rewrites requests for the UI so that the static files handler
            will pick up either the native Dart code or the compiled JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you place any output cache middleware in front of this middleware the output cache will be
            instructed not to cache this data because otherwise some browsers would receive the files
            thet don't work with it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Dart middleware in the OwinFramework supports the following configuration options:
        </p>
        <table class="properties">
            <tr>
                <th>Property</th>
                <th>Default</th>
                <th>Current</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="property">UiRootUrl</td>
                <td>{uiRootUrl.default}</td>
                <td>{uiRootUrl}</td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                        Configures the URL within your web site where the Dart UI will be served. If your whole web site
                        is written as Dart Single Page Application you can set this to <span class="code">/</span> so that 
                        when visitors to your site go to http://mysite.com/ they will be presented with the Dart authored UI.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The default setting for this property is <span class="code">/ui</span> which means that any requests
                        to your site that begin with <span class="code">/ui</span> could be served as Dart files or related
                        assets. So for example a URL like <span class="code">/ui/images/logo.jpg</span> would be treated as
                        a resource for your Dart application.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This middleware will only rewrite the request URL. It assumes that there are other middleware further
                        down the pipeline that will return the content of these files. In the simplest case you can add
                        the static files middleware further down the pipelane than this one. You might also want to include
                        the LESS on-the-fly compiler middleware too.
                    </p>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="property">DartUiRootUrl</td>
                <td>{dartUiRootUrl.default}</td>
                <td>{dartUiRootUrl}</td>
                <td>
                    <p>
                        Configures the root URL that will be passed down the middleware pipeline when the browser making
                        the request can execute Dart files directly. If you are using the static files middleware to serve
                        these files then this url should map to the root folder for the uncompiled Dart files.
                    </p>

            </tr>

                <td>
                    <p>
                        Configures the root URL that will be passed down the middleware pipeline when the browser making
                        the request can not execute Dart directly, and needs so be served compiled JavaScript. If you are 
                        using the static files middleware to serve these files then this url should map to the root folder 
                        for the compiled JavaScript files.

                    <p>
                        Configures the file that will be served when the Dart UI folder URL is requested with no
                        file name in the URL. With the default configuration, a request for <span class="code">http://mysite.com/ui</span>
                        will be rewritten to <span class="code">/ui/web/index.html</span> for browsers that support
                        Dart and <span class="code">/ui/build/web/index.html</span> for browsers that do not support Dart.

                    <p>
                        Configures the URL within your web site where configutation documentation for this
                        middleware will be avialble. Set this to an empty string to disable this documentation
                        in a production environment.

            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            This middleware is configured the same way as all other middleware in the Owin Framework; you need 
            to construct a class that implements <span class="code">IConfiguration</span> then add a fluid 
            <span class="code">.ConfigureWith()</span> when you register this middleware with the Owin 
            Framework builder. Please read Owin Framework documentation on configuration for full details with examples.
